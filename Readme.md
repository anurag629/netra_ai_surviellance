## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO, face_recognition
- **Deployment**: Docker, Azure

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3.7+
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/surveillance-system.git
    cd surveillance-system
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download YOLO configuration and weights files**:
    - Download `yolov3.cfg` from: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg
    - Download `yolov3.weights` from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
    - Download `coco.names` from: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names

    Place these files in a directory named `backend/app/yolo` inside the project root directory.

5. **Run the FastAPI server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install the required npm packages**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the React development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Docker Setup (Optional)

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t surveillance-system .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 surveillance-system
    ```

## Usage

1. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend.

2. **Navigate to the Dashboard**:
   The dashboard displays the real-time camera feed and the location map.

3. **Manage Persons and Cameras**:
   Navigate to the "Manage" section from the navbar to add, edit, or delete persons and cameras.
